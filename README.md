# Social-Network-API

## Description
This repository provides the complete backend and API routing for a social network site.  Using an API tester such as Insomnia, the user can create new Users in the network, add Thoughts, and then add Reactions to the thoughts.  Users can have friends (set up right now as one-way relationships), Thoughts and Reactions have authors, and a Thought has a group of Reactions saved as a response to it.

The database is created using MongoDB, using Express for the routes.

## Instructions
To use the application, download the repository, and then run "npm i" in a terminal.  After installing the node packages, run the application by entering "node index.js" in the root level of the folder.  

You will then be able to interact with the database through Insomnia.  To see the routes, view the files in the routes folder.

## Required software
Any terminal/command line application is adequate to use this program.  You must also install node.js on your computer to download the other dependencies and run the program in the terminal.  Also Insomnia or Postman.
